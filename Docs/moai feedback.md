# /moai feedback

Command to submit feedback or bug reports for MoAI-ADK.

<Callout type="info">

**New Command Format**

`/moai:9-feedback` has been changed to `/moai feedback`.

</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
**One-line summary**: `/moai feedback` is a command that **automatically creates GitHub issues** for improvement suggestions or bug reports about MoAI-ADK itself.
</Callout>

## Overview

Use this command when you find a bug while using MoAI-ADK, need a new feature, or have an improvement idea. You don't need to visit GitHub directly - you can submit feedback right from within Claude Code.

<Callout type="info">
**Important**: This command is **not for modifying your project code**. It's for conveying feedback about the MoAI-ADK tool itself to the development team.
</Callout>

## Usage

```bash
# Standard form
> /moai feedback

# Short aliases
> /moai fb
> /moai bug
> /moai issue
```

When you execute the command, you'll be guided through selecting feedback type and entering content.

## Supported Flags

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--type {bug,feature,question}` | Directly specify feedback type | `/moai feedback --type bug` |
| `--title "<title>"` | Directly specify title | `/moai feedback --title "Error report"` |
| `--dry-run` | Check content only without creating issue | `/moai feedback --dry-run` |

## Feedback Types

### Bug Report

Report errors or unexpected behavior encountered while using MoAI-ADK.

```bash
> /moai feedback
# Type selection: Bug Report
# Title: Characterization tests not created during /moai run
# Description: I ran /moai run for SPEC-AUTH-001, but characterization tests
#        weren't created in the PRESERVE phase and it went straight to IMPROVE.
# Reproduction: Run /moai run SPEC-AUTH-001
```

### Feature Request

Suggest new features you'd like to see added to MoAI-ADK.

```bash
> /moai feedback
# Type selection: Feature Request
# Title: Add option to target specific files only in /moai loop
# Description: It would be great if /moai loop could target only specific directories or
#        files instead of the entire project.
# Example: /moai loop --path src/auth/
```

### Improvement Proposal

Propose ideas for improving existing features.

```bash
> /moai feedback
# Type selection: Improvement Proposal
# Title: Show before/after diff in /moai fix execution results
# Description: If /moai fix showed its automatic fixes in diff format,
#        we could see at a glance what changes were made.
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I edit or delete feedback content?

Yes, you can edit or close the issue directly on GitHub. Since the issue URL is provided, you can access it anytime.

### Q: Can I report the same problem multiple times?

Don't worry - GitHub checks for duplicate issues. If the problem has already been reported, you'll be guided to the existing issue.

### Q: When will I receive a response to my feedback?

The development team reviews and comments on issues weekly. Complex problems may take time to resolve.

### Q: What's the difference between `/moai feedback` and creating GitHub issues directly?

`/moai feedback` automatically collects environment information, helping the development team understand problems faster. It's more efficient than manually creating issues.
